### Method 2: Column Format
```

## üîß **Upload Steps**

1. **Prepare Your File**:

   - Remove any "Total" rows or summary data

2. **Upload Process**:
   - Click "Upload Data" button in the top-right corner
   - Select your prepared file
   - Wait for the green "Analytics updated successfully" message

3. **Verification**:
   - Check if the "Total Brands" count updated
   - Verify new stock values are displayed
   - Browse through all 5 tabs to see your data

## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "Invalid file type" error
**Solution**: Ensure your file has `.xlsx`, `.xls`, or `.csv` extension

### Issue 2: "Insufficient numerical data" error
**Solution**: Make sure you have 3 numbers (ID, Rate, Quantity) for each brand

### Issue 3: Upload seems to work but no data appears
**Solution**: 
- Refresh the page
- Check if brand names contain special characters
- Ensure numerical data is properly formatted

### Issue 4: File is too large
