The trajectory documents an iterative development process for a sophisticated liquor sales analysis dashboard. The project started with a user request for a tool to analyze sales patterns and identify overstocked items from an Excel file. The development progressed through multiple phases, driven entirely by user feedback.

Initial development focused on creating a basic dashboard with file upload and configurable overstock calculations. Subsequent user requests led to the addition of an onboarding guide, advanced performance charts, and a demand forecasting feature. A key event was a user-requested rollback, removing the advanced features, only to be re-requested with a new dataset and modified requirements.

The most significant challenges revolved around data parsing and business logic implementation. The AI engineer had to repeatedly debug and refine the backend logic to handle various user-provided Excel formats, data inconsistencies, and evolving calculation rules. The core of the work involved translating complex, domain-specific requirements from the user—particularly the precise logic for determining the sales analysis period (D1/DL dates)—into robust Python code using the Pandas library. The final state of the application reflects a highly customized analysis tool tailored to the user's exact specifications, with a verification table built specifically for validating these complex calculations.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a full-stack web application that serves as a dynamic dashboard for analyzing liquor sales and inventory data from a user-uploaded Excel file.

**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Data Upload:** Users must be able to upload an Excel (, ) or CSV file containing daily liquor stock data. The application must parse this tabular data, which includes columns for an index, brand name, wholesale rate, selling rate, and multiple date-stamped columns showing stock quantity.
2.  **Overstock Analysis:** The dashboard must identify overstocked brands. A brand is considered overstocked if its current stock value is greater than its average monthly sales value by a user-configurable multiplier (defaulting to 3x).
3.  **Sales Calculation Logic:**
    *   The analysis period starts on a specific date, D1, and ends on the last available date in the data, DL.
    *   **D1 Logic:** D1 is defined as the first date across the entire dataset where *any* brand's stock quantity increases, signifying a restocking event. If no restocking event is found, D1 defaults to the earliest date in the data. This D1 date must be applied globally to all brands for the calculation period.
    *   **Average Monthly Sale:** This is calculated by finding the average daily sale ((Stock at D1 - Stock at DL) / number of days) and multiplying it by 24.
4.  **Dashboard Visualization:**
    *   A main dashboard view summarizing key metrics (e.g., total brands, total stock value).
    *   A line chart showing sales trends over time.
    *   Performance Charts tab showing top-performing brands by sales revenue and proportion of total sales.
    *   Demand Forecast tab with a downloadable Excel sheet listing recommended purchase quantities. The export must contain specific columns: Index, Brand Name, Wholesale Rate, Quantity in Stock, and Quantity to be Demanded.
    *   A Calculation Verification table displaying the detailed calculated values for each brand (Index, D1 Stock, DL Stock, Calculated Monthly Sale, Current Stock Value, Multiplier) to allow for easy validation against manual calculations.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the core of the application, containing all business logic. It handles the  endpoint, which uses Pandas to read the uploaded Excel file. It implements the complex, multi-step logic for identifying global D1 (restocking) and DL dates, calculating sales, overstock status, and demand forecasts for each brand. It also defines Pydantic models for data validation and structures the data for various API endpoints (, , ).
    - **Changes:** This file underwent the most significant modifications. It was repeatedly refactored to:
        - Fix data parsing errors for different Excel structures.
        - Correct data type conversion issues.
        - Implement and iteratively refine the complex D1/DL date detection logic based on precise user requirements.
        - Add new endpoints for the verification table, charts, and demand forecasting.
        - Enhance logging for debugging purposes.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This file is the single-page application's main component. It manages the entire UI, including the layout with tabs for the main dashboard, performance charts, demand recommendations, and the calculation verification table. It handles user interactions, such as triggering the file input dialog, making  API calls to the backend upon successful file upload, managing application state (e.g., loading status, analytics data), and rendering all the data into tables and charts using Shadcn UI and .
    - **Changes:** This file was heavily edited to:
        - Add new tabs and components to display advanced analytics and the verification table.
        - Fix a critical bug where the Upload Data button did not trigger the file dialog.
        - Implement better user feedback mechanisms, like toasts for success/error messages during file upload.
        - Structure the API calls to fetch data for the various dashboard sections.
        - Format and display the complex nested data returned from the backend in a user-friendly way.

    - **Importance:** These markdown files were created to provide documentation directly to the user. They explain how to deploy the application and the correct format for the Excel upload, respectively.
    - **Changes:** These files were created upon user request to improve usability and clarify operational procedures.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no outstanding tasks. The last user request regarding the correction of the D1/DL calculation logic was successfully implemented and verified.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent and critical work involved a complete overhaul of the backend's core calculation logic to match the user's precise business rules for sales analysis. The user specified that the analysis start date (D1) must be the single, global date on which any brand in the dataset first shows a stock increase, representing a restocking event. The end date (DL) must be the last date available in the data.

This required a significant refactor of the data processing function in . The previous logic incorrectly identified D1 on a per-brand basis. The new implementation iterates through the entire dataset to find the global D1 date and then applies this date consistently across all brands to calculate sales (). This ensures that all analysis is performed over the same, correct time period.

The fix was validated by creating a specific test Excel file that mimicked the user's data pattern, uploading it, and checking the backend logs to confirm that the correct global D1 and DL dates were detected. The final step was to verify that the Calculation Verification tab on the frontend accurately reflected these corrected calculations, which was confirmed via a screenshot showing the right D1/DL stock values for each brand. The application is now in a state where its core analysis logic aligns with the user's final, detailed requirements.
